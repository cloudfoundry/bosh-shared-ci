# release-notes contains the following files
# - release-notes.md - release notes that includes a "### Package Updates:" header and then a list of the updated packages with the syntax "* Updates EXAMPLE_PACKAGE from PREVIOUS_VERSION to NEW_VERSION".
#                      If release-notes were passed in as `release-notes.md` in the `release-notes` input, the new notes will be appended to the end.

run:
  path: bosh-shared-ci/tasks/release/check-for-updated-vendored-packages.sh

params:
# Array of packages to check. These strings must match the folder names for the packages.
# The task will determine the version of the vendored package by extracting a version number
# from the last commit to the package using the regex '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+'. So your auto bump
# of packages need to include the version number in the commit message.
# All provided PACKAGES are checked in a single run of the task.
